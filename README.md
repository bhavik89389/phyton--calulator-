# phyton--calulator-
this repository incudes a basic calculator using phyton which can perform simple arithematic oerations 
 The programme is done only using phyton 
 this is a basic project in phyton which only uses fundamentals in phyton 
 no NUMpy and Pandas are included 

 The basic calculator :
 explanation 
 1.
 Import Tkinter:
We import tkinter for creating the GUI and messagebox for showing error dialogs.
2.
declared expression as a global variable 
3.
used 4 functions in the code :
a.update_expression(value): Adds the clicked button's value to the current expression.
b.evaluate_expression(): Uses Python's built-in eval() function to evaluate the expression and display the result. If there is an error (like dividing by zero), it shows "Error".
c.clear_input(): Clears the expression and resets the display.
d.backspace(): Removes the last character from the expression.
the above functions works as defined 
4.
Buttons:
used buttons to create numbers and arithemetic operations and aligned them using grid() function for easy organisation 
Buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and additional functionalities like backspace, clear (C), square root (âˆš), and power (^) are created.
5.
used if else statements and some operators in backend to show the correct and desired output
